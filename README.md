In the dataset we will mainly focus on Theater category, it's outcomes

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

In the Outcomes based on launch date, I noticed that April to July are best time of launching campaigns.  
The month of May is where we have success rate comparing to the rest of the months of the year. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The Outcomes based on Goals, The data shows that as the price goal increases there is high chance that our campaign will fail.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The limitations about this data is that not only outcome based on date launched or goal will define the success of this campaigns, 
we will have to consider other apsects like which country we have a high successful rate. 
How much people are pledging to atteign our goal. And in which means are they pledging, are they paying online or cash. 
I would do more calculations like cental tendecies, Range and IQR to better determine my outliers. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

- Possible graph that can help my analysis will be Box and Whisker plots to better determine my outliers,
 a column chart to determine which subcategories are performing better than others. 
 
- I will consider as well another pivot table to be able to filter countries for both category and subcategory
 so that i can analyze in which country we are having successful compaigns.
