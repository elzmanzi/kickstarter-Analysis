# kickstarter-Analysis
## Overview of Project
In this project, we will performing Analysis on Kickstarter data from 2009 to 2017 to determine whether there is some factors that detemines a campaign to be successful or fail. we will focus on  the category of theater and plays subcategory.   

### Purpose

This project is about a crowdfunding project. We will analyse compaigns outcomes comparing to innitial goal funding and launch dates. 
In the dataset we will mainly focus on Theater category, it's outcomes
based on launch date. 
In the same Theater category we will look at  subcategory of plays and analyse it's outcomes based on goal. 

## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
![This is an image](https://github.com/elzmanzi/kickstarter-Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)
- Outcomes based on launch date graph shown above is  that the best months to launch campaigns are starting from April to July, it appears to be a good season for plays. 
- the month December is not the good month at all, the number of successfull campaign is almost equal to the failed ones. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
- By comparing those failed and successful using central tendancy measures, i found that mean of failed is almost twice as the successful ones,
- There is a huge difference  between mean and median for both failed and successful campaign, this might be in the high increase in goal value. 
- the third quartile is almost similar to mean, which may suggest that data follows the same distributions 
- on the Failied kickstarter the standard deviation is almost three times compairing to the IQR, which maybe high goal money could be the potential issue of failing. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

The possible challenges that could be encountered is to well determine how to reach the intended community so that we can maximize the pledged amount to reach our goals. We may need to know what paltforms to use to reach the crowd. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

In the Outcomes based on launch date, I noticed that April to July are best time of launching campaigns.  
The month of May is where we have success rate comparing to the rest of the months of the year. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The Outcomes based on Goals, The data shows that as the price goal increases there is high chance that our campaign will fail.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The limitations about this data is that not only outcome based on date launched or goal will define the success of this campaigns, 
we will have to consider other apsects like which country we have a high successful rate. 
How much people are pledging to atteign our goal. And in which means are they pledging, are they paying online or cash. 
I would do more calculations like cental tendecies, Range and IQR to better determine my outliers. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

- Possible graph that can help my analysis will be Box and Whisker plots to better determine my outliers,
 a column chart to determine which subcategories are performing better than others. 
 
- I will consider as well another pivot table to be able to filter countries for both category and subcategory
 so that i can analyze in which country we are having successful compaigns.
